## **Menu Settings**

WordPress provides a flexible menu management system that allows you to create and organize navigation menus for your website.  
Our theme fully supports the native WordPress Menu system, making it easy to manage header, footer, and other navigation areas.

### **Menu Structure**

The **Menu Structure** panel allows you to:

- **Reorder items:** Drag and drop to change the menu hierarchy.  
- **Nest items:** Indent items to create dropdown submenus.  
- **Edit labels:** Click the dropdown arrow on any menu item to change its label or settings.

Example menu items may include:

- Our Portfolio  
- Our Services  
- Our Team

### **Menu Settings (Display Locations)**

At the bottom of the screen, under **Menu Settings**, you can assign where the menu will appear on your site.

Available options typically include:

- **Primary Menu** – The main navigation, usually located in the site header.  
- **Footer Menu** – A secondary menu displayed in the footer area.

To assign a menu to a location, check the appropriate box (e.g., **Footer Menu**) and click **Save Menu**.

### **Tips**

- You can manage multiple menus and assign them to different theme locations.  
- Elementor templates (such as custom headers and footers) can also dynamically display menus using the **Nav Menu** widget.  
- If you import demo data, predefined menus are usually created and assigned automatically.

This setup ensures your navigation menus are fully functional and integrated with the theme layout.
