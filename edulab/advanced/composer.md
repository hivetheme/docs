# Composer Commands Documentation

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that allows you to declare and manage the libraries your project depends on. This document outlines common Composer commands and their usage scenarios.

## Installation Commands

### Basic Installation

```
composer install
```

Use this command when:
- Setting up a project for the first time
- After cloning a repository
- When the `vendor` directory is missing
- When encountering `500 Internal Server Error` due to missing packages

This command reads the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files and installs all dependencies as specified in the lock file.

### Production Installation

```
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

Use this command in production environments to:
- Install only production dependencies (skips development dependencies)
- Generate an optimized autoloader for better performance

## Update Commands

### Update All Packages

```
composer update
```

Use this command when:
- You want to update all dependencies to their latest versions according to the version constraints in `composer.json`
- After adding new modules programmatically or through a web interface
- After manually uploading packages that need to be recognized by the system

### Update Specific Package

```
composer update vendor/package
```

Use this command to update a specific package while keeping all other dependencies at their current versions.

## Autoloader Commands

### Basic Autoloader Regeneration

```
composer dump-autoload
```

Use this command when:
- You encounter `500 Internal Server Error` due to autoloading issues
- After adding new classes that need to be autoloaded
- After making changes to the PSR-4 or classmap autoloading in your project

### Optimized Autoloader Regeneration

```
composer dump-autoload --optimize
```

Use this command in production environments to:
- Generate a more efficient autoloader by converting PSR-0/PSR-4 autoloading to classmap
- Improve application performance by reducing file lookups

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a `500 Internal Server Error` or your site crashes, follow these steps:

1. Check if the `vendor` directory exists in your project root
2. If the `vendor` directory is missing, run `composer install`
3. If the `vendor` directory exists but issues persist, run `composer dump-autoload`
4. For production environments, use the optimized versions of commands:
   - `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`
   - `composer dump-autoload --optimize`

## Best Practices

- Always commit your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files to version control
- Do not commit the `vendor` directory to version control
- Use `composer install` when deploying to ensure consistency across environments
- Use `composer update` sparingly and with caution in production environments
- Run `composer dump-autoload --optimize` after deployment to production for better performance
