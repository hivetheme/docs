## Theme Install via FTP

- Using an FTP client (like FileZilla), connect to your server/hosting and navigate to
your WordPress installation.
- Navigate to /wp-content/themes/ folder and upload the theme folder there (you need to
unzip the theme transova.zip package first).
- Locate your WordPress installation and upload the theme directory <b>transova</b>
(you unzipped in the previous step) into <b>../wp-content/themes/</b> in your WordPress
installation.
- Log in to your WP Admin Dashboard and go to <strong> Appearance > Themes </strong>
- You will now see transova listed among the other themes. Just activate it!
